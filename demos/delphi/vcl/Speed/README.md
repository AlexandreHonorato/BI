## Speed benchmark tests

This project evaluates several common TeeBI features to determine their individual speeds and find potential speed degradations over releases.

The results below were obtained using a 2014 Intel Haswell cpu i7-4770, with no overclocking, single-cpu single-thread only, under Windows 10 x64.

Project compiled using Embarcadero RAD Studio 10 Seattle, default Release mode.
